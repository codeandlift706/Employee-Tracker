## Contribution
The coding (imports, MySQL connection, MySQL queries, inquirer questions array, init function, creating tables and seeding the data) -all the additions- are credited to the curriculum taught by the instructor in the UCI coding boot camp. A tutor from the UCI coding boot camp also helped provide guidance on the MySQL queries. The assignment also gave instructions for setting up the database structures.
Information to structure the prompts can be found here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4.
To use JOIN for multiple tables, I referenced: https://learnsql.com/cookbook/how-to-join-on-multiple-columns/ and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9810343/retrieving-data-from-three-tables-using-mysql. To self-reference in a MySQL table, I referenced: https://pencilprogrammer.com/self-referencing-foreign-key-in-mysql/ and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2971593/self-referential-table-fields-in-mysql.

## Tests
To test the functionality of the Employee-Tracker, users can clone this repo, run npm install, and follow the video for steps on creating the schema from the MySQL shell (open the terminal and log into mysql, run ‘SOURCE schema.sql;’ in the command line, run ‘SOURCE seeds.sql;’ in the command line to seed the data), and starting the application’s server (run “node server” in the command line). Select any option from the list. To view any updates or changes made to the existing database, at the end, select “View all Employees”.
